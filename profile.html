<h2>Jowler Creek Vineyard & Winery</h2>
<p>Jowler Creek Winery is family owned and operated boutique vineyard and winery located 30 minutes north of Kansas City. Founders Jason and Collen Gerke use green technologies such as solar power, to make their wines. Sheep control weeds and pest control is left to chickens.</p>

<p>The couple currently makes nine wines from Norton, Vignoles, Traminette and Cabernet Franc vines. The wines are fruit-forward, easy to drink and easy to pair with food. VineReviews highly recommends the Vignoles, which has a floral nose with notes of peaches and citrus.</p>

<p>You can find Jowler Creek at 16905 Jowler Creek Road in Platte City, Missouri. Tasting room hours are Wednesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. But for those who can't make it Jowler Creek can find their wines in 75 local stores in Kansas and Missouri.</p>
