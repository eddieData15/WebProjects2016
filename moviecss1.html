<h1>The Big Easy</h1>

<p>
Filmed in 1987, <i>The Big Easy</i> is a romantic thriller set in New Orleans. Det. Remy McSwain is called to the scene of a murder. His investigation leads him into conflict with the city's new district attorney, Ann Osborne who has a penchant for following the "letter of the law" to the letter. The two work together to solve the murder which evolves into a larger case of corruption and puts McSwain and Osborne in danger. The story line is engaging, and the chemistry between McSwain and Osborne is hotter than a bayou summer. The soundtrack also is a gem and features the Neville Brothers' classic, <i>Tell It Like It Is</i>.
